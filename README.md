# How to Start?

## General Installation

1. Clone the Repo
2. Prepare the data

    1. Data ([download](https://mega.nz/file/5jFiAKoa#cNITq38YDnAyqS3eGzWncJJ7XPfO4FPvYPS5xjQMYqA))
    2. Model ([download](https://mega.nz/file/Eyk0Qa6L#IbLmo7_ZE_1TYyGnH7kM8uSOKkRhbBTGiLkbJiAyRCE))
      - Models are also available at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/kaanakdeniz)

    Download all the data and model from the links provided above, unzip/ unarchive the data, and then copy the `data` ve `model` folders to the main directory in the repo.

3. Make sure you have `Python 3.9.13` installed on your system
4. In order to use the GitHub API, you need to rename the `example.config.ini` file to `config.ini` and enter your api token.
5. Follow the steps specified in [Requirements](#Requirements)

## Requirements

1. Use `pip install poetry` command to install poetry.
2. Install all the necessary using `poetry install` command.
3. Use `poetry shell` command to enter the poetry virtual environment.
4. (_Optional_) Install pytorch-cuda version with `poe install` command to run pytorch over GPU.

    _Note: CUDA must be installed in your system to do this step._
# Project Structure
## Data
1. **acl**:
The directory contains the Readme files corresponding to articles collected from the ACL Anthology site, and the training data composed of these Readme contents.
1. **constants**:
This directory is the repository for the static data utilized during the development process.
1. **paperswithcode**:
This includes the data used during the system's evaluation.
## Models

It is the directory where the pretrained models used in the system are located.
## Notebooks
1. **data-analysis-statistics:**
Data analyses and statistical analysis codes.
2. **data-gathering:**
Data collection process codes.
3. **data-preparation:**
Data preparation process codes.
4. **e2e-system:**
Evaluation of the system codes.
5. **labelling:**
Data labeling and agreement calculation codes.
6. **training:**
Model training codes.

## End-to-end System
The directory where the main code files of the system are located.  You can import the classes here and use them in different codes.

## Util
This directory contains helper classes such as readme parser, github helper.

# Training
In the _notebooks/training_ directory you can find the code for training both the hierarchical and the BERT model. It can be run after editing the data and model paths.

# Evaluation
In the _notebooks/e2e-system_ directory you can find the code for evaluating the system. It can be run after editing the data and model paths.

# Results
Performance results of the system are below.
